You are about to help implement a PASGI reference server — a modern, async Perl version of ASGI.

First, carefully read all specifications in `/docs` and `/docs/specs`. Then read the implementation plan in `IMPLEMENTATION.md`.

Before writing any code, review all of the requirements and constraints and confirm that you fully understand the PASGI protocol, data types, event lifecycles, and architecture expectations.

List:
- Any areas you find ambiguous or unclear
- Any missing pieces you need clarified
- Any assumptions you might need to make to proceed

Once you’re confident that the spec is fully understood, we’ll begin writing code.
